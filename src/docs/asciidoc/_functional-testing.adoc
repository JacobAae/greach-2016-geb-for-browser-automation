[NOTE.speaker]
Unit testing does not check integrations

=== Functional testing

* Ignores the specifics of the underlying software component under test.
** Whitebox / Greybox
* Merely asserts that providing certain input results in certain output.
* *Web-application:* Programmatically controlling a web browser to simulate the actions of a user on a web page.
